Website for Classroom SchedulingWebsite for Classroom Scheduling

Developed this website from scratch with a mission to make the teaching and learning experience more efficient and user-friendly. Here are the key features:

 Teacher-Friendly Interface: Teachers can effortlessly schedule their classes. All they need to do is enter their name, and the system generates a secure password.

 Password-Protected Access: The password created by the teachers is securely stored in a Django database, ensuring privacy and security. Students can use this password to join their respective classes.

 Django Database Integration: To manage all the data efficiently, I utilized Django's robust database capabilities. This allows for easy data retrieval and management, ensuring a smooth user experience.

User-Friendly Templates: The website's user interface was designed with a focus on ease of use, with HTML templates that offer a clean and intuitive experience for both teachers and students.
